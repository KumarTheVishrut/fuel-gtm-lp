# Prompt: Build a High-Conversion Next.js Landing Page for FUEL

**Role:** Expert Frontend Engineer & B2B Conversion Specialist.
**Goal:** Build a high-performance, single-page Next.js site with a **"Black & White / Modern Tech"** aesthetic.

### 1. Visual Directives

* **Palette:** Pure Monochrome. Deep Black (#000000) and Stark White (#FFFFFF).
* **Typography:** Large, aggressive headings (Inter Tight or Geist Sans). Mono-spaced fonts for sub-headers to give a "technical/intelligence" feel.
* **Containers:** No rounded corners (`rounded-none`). Thin 1px borders for card elements.
* **Motion:** Use `framer-motion` for staggered entrance animations (fade up).

### 2. Copy Architecture (The Flow)

* **Section 1: Hero (The Hook)**
* **Headline:** GTM ARCHITECTURE.
* **Sub-headline:** A multi-disciplinary consultancy for SaaS and complex tech. We refine your ICP, build your sales team, and execute outbound engines through direct frontline intelligence.
* **CTAs:** [CONSULT WITH AN OPERATOR] (Primary) | [VIEW SERVICE ARMS] (Secondary Outline).


* **Section 2: The Three Pillars (Service Arms)**
* **Arm A: OUTBOUND EXECUTION.** *“We don't just find leads; we navigate complex sales motions and refine your ICP to spark qualified conversations.”*
* **Arm B: ELITE RECRUITING.** *“A dedicated headhunting arm focused on sourcing high-performance sales leaders and GTM operators.”*
* **Arm C: INSIGHTS & AUTOMATION.** *“Proprietary tech packages and automation bots providing granular frontline intelligence on your TAM.”*


* **Section 3: The Edge (The Thesis)**
* **Title:** Intelligence from the Frontlines.
* **Body:** We gain granular insights into your market by engaging directly with operators. We see how your product fits the market pulse because we are in the trenches, not just analyzing data.


* **Section 4: Strategic Services (The Grid)**
* Display these as a clean 2x2 grid:
* GTM Messaging Strategy
* Pricing & Packaging
* Sales Hiring Frameworks
* Board-Facing Planning




* **Section 5: The Models & Final CTA**
* **Highlight:** FLEXIBLE MODELS: PAY-PER-MEETING / PROFIT SHARE / EQUITY.
* **Footer Callout:** REFINE YOUR MARKET MOTION.
* **Contact Link:** donp@fuel-bd.com



### 3. Technical Implementation

* Use `lucide-react` for minimal icons (e.g., a radar icon for Insights, a target for Outbound).
* Ensure the "Flexible Models" section stands out as a high-contrast banner (e.g., White text on Black background if the rest of the page is White).
* Implement a sticky navigation bar with only the Logo (FUEL) and the "Consult" CTA.
